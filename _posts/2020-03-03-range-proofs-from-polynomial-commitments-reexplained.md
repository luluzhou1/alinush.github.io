{: .info}
This is a re-exposition of a [post](https://hackmd.io/@dabo/B1U4kx8XI) by Dan Boneh, Ben Fisch, Ariel Gabizon on how to obtain a constant-sized range proof from constant-sized polynomial commitments.

This post was moved to [Decentralized Thoughts](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-03-02-range-proofs-from-polynomial-commitments-reexplained/).
