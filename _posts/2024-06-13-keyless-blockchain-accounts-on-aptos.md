**tl;dr:** What is a **keyless blockchain account**?
Put simply, _"Your blockchain account = Your Google account"_. 
In other words, this keyless approach allows you to derive a blockchain account from any of your existing OpenID Connect (OIDC) account (e.g., Google, Apple), rather than from a traditional secret key or mnemonic. 
There are no long-term secret keys you need to manage.
There is also no multi-party computation (MPC) system managing your account for you.
As a result, the risk of account loss is (more or less), the risk of losing your Google account.
Keyless is built using a [Groth16](/groth16) zero-knowledge proof to maintain privacy in both directions: prevent the blockchain from learning anything about your Google account & prevent Google from learning anything about your blockchain account and transaction activity.

## FAQ

### Who is this for?

So far, cryptocurrencies have been designed for power users who understand public-key cryptography.

In constrast, Keyless accounts are for any Web 2 user who has used the "Sign in with Google[^not-just-google]" flow before. (Basically, for everyone.)

Keyless accounts are primarily designed **for the bottom 90% of users**; _novice users_ who are not yet ready to manager their own 12-word seed phrase, mnemonic or secret key.

Such users often tend to:
 - lose their key, or
 - get phished for their key, or
 - accidentally-paste their key somewhere they shouldn't

But, keyless accounts were designed also **for first-time users**, who deserve and expect a smooth on-boarding experience when interacting with a dapp.

{: .warning}
**Newsflash:** Downloading a _new_ wallet for every _new_ chain and writing down a _new_ (extremely-sensitive) 12-word seed phrase is **not** smooth.
(It's not even sane.)
Reusing an existing 12-word seed phrase is not smooth either. Plus, would you want to? Do you trust this _new_ wallet on this _new_ chain?[^hardware-wallet]

### Can Google steal my keyless account?

_In principle_, keyless accounts can be set up so that, **if a malicious Google tries to steal your account, you have the power to stop it** by sending a cancellation TXN within a timeout period (e.g., 1 day)[^cancellation-txns].

*In practice* though, this **higher-security mode** of operation will not lead to the best user experience (e.g., across different devices[^esk-across-devices] or when a user's browser session is lost[^esk-not-in-local-storage]).
As a result, this is not the recommended mode on the [Aptos network](https://x.com/aptos), nor the most-widely supported one.

Instead, Aptos defaults to a **user-friendly mode** where users can access their account easily from different devices (even if the browser's history has been cleaned).
For this to work, Google must be allowed to sign TXNs on the user's behalf without a timeout period (see [flow](#flow-end-to-end-keyless-transacting)).
As a result, a malicious (or compromised) Google could abuse this power and steal a user's account. 

Is this okay?
Well, you have to [remember who keyless accounts are for](#who-is-this-for).

_First_, they are for **first-time users** who are not interested in (or know much about) 12-word mnemonics; they just want to easily sign up for your your dapp!
_Second_, they are for **novice users** who understand very little about the responsibility of custodying a 12-word seed phrase or mnemonic.

So, yes, this **is** okay, because the biggest threat for this user base is **key loss (or theft) caused by the user themselves.**
It's not Google.

Then, as a developer, if you want to (1) on-board users smoothly and (2) prevent them from shooting themselves in the foot, then **you should use keyless**[^optionality].

Put differently, Google can **protect** these users' keyless accounts much, **much** better than the users are able to secure a 12-word seed phrases.

{: .note}
Google's own bottom line depends on their ability to protect their OpenID Connect (OIDC) secret keys which secure your keyless account because **those same keys secure the widely-used "Sign in with Google" flow** all across the web!

<!--
#### But what if I am really important and Google steals my keyless account?

Yes, if you are important Google, or the NSA, or Lazarus, or God knows who will steal your account.

But you are likely not.

### Can Google lock me out of my keyless account? 

{: .todo}
Yes.
How likely is this to happen?
Is it more likely for you to lock yourself out if you manage your 12-word seed phrase. Yes!

{: .todo}
Also, it depends how determined Google is to do this. (e.g., maybe you still have your email)

{: .todo}
Use a cold backup key?
zkEmail reset.

### Can Google ban my keyless dapp?

{: .todo}
Yes.
How likely is this to happen?
Unclear, but you can prepare for it: add a 2nd factor (e.g., add Apple or an SK or a zkEmail).
Or, recovery service.

### Can Google passively monitor TXNs?

{: .todo}
Passively-malicious Google vs. actively-malicious.

#### My TXNs

#### All TXNs

### What if my Google is hacked?

{: .todo}
2FA.
"You've done well so far."

### What if I lose my pepper?

{: .todo}
Designed to preclude that problem: pepper service has got your back.

### But this is not decentralized, right?

{: todo}
The design **is** decentralized: prover service can be de-centralized, so can pepper-service.
The current deployment is not there yet, but will be.

### But this is not privacy preserving, right?

{: todo}
Same: design **is**, but prover & pepper services are not yet privacy-preserving.

### What if this takes off? Won't Google own us all?

### TODO
2 out of 3 across same email but different providers
2 out of 3 across same provider but your friends' emails
securing $1,000 dollars vs. $1,000,000 dollars -- kind of like adding mfa in Web2

### Flow: End-to-end keyless transacting 

Depicts the full keyless flow: the user generating an ESK and EPK, the user signing into the dapp with the EPK as the OIDC `nonce`, the dapp getting a JWT, exchanging it for a pepper, getting a ZKP from the prover service, the user signing a TXN with their ESK, the dapp sending the TXN containing the ZKP and ephemeral signature, and finally the blockchain verifying everything.

### Flow: End-to-end keyless ZKless-transacting (currently, disabled)

In case of emergency (e.g., a serious soundness issue in the ZK circuit), keyless supports a **ZKless** mode that is **not** privacy preserving.
This, of course, is currently **disabled** on Aptos mainnet.

We depicts this (simpler) ZKless flow: the user generating an ESK and EPK, the user signing into the dapp with the EPK as the OIDC `nonce`, the dapp getting a JWT, the user signing a TXN with their ESK, the dapp sending the TXN containing the ephemeral signature, and finally the blockchain verifying everything.

## Apendix

{% include keyless-defs.md %}

This will serve as an appendix of technical information, useful when communicationg about keyless accounts internally and externally.

{: .note}
The notation below will not be explicitly defined; just exercise intuition! 
e.g., $\maxaudval$ is clearly the maximum number of bytes in $\audval$.

### BN254

Currently, the Aptos keyless relation is implemented using [circom](/circom) with a Groth16 backend over the BN254 elliptic curve[^bn254] of order $r$, where $2^{253} < r < 2^{254}$:

### base64url

Recall that **base64** is a way to convert an **input** of $\ell$ bytes into an output of $m=\lceil 4\ell / 3\rceil$ **base64 characters** from an alphabet of size 64.

Base64 works by sequentially converting each group of 6 bits (so $2^6 = 64$ possibilities) to an 8-bit letter in this **base64 alphabet**.
Note that this blows up the **encoded length** by around $8/6 = 4/3 = 1.25\times$.

{: .note}
Why base64-encode stuff?
Because it is sometimes useful to take arbitrary bytes and convert them to a displayable string format.
(For example, hexadecimal is another such format, albeit the conversion.

The base64 algorithm encodes every 24-bit **input chunk** (i.e., every 3 bytes) into a 32-bit **output chunk** (i.e., 4 base64 characters), properly handling things when $\ell \bmod 3 \ne 0$ (see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Examples)):

Specifically, the last input chunk could be of either length:
 - $\ell \bmod 3 = 2$ bytes
    + then, the algorithm **pads** this last 2-byte input chunk (16 bits) with 2 zero bits
        - the **padded** chunk's length is now 18 bits and thus divisible by 6
    - encode this 18-bit padded input chunk as 3-character output chunk
    - append an `=` **padding character** to the output chunk
        + to indicate that the last 2 zero bits in the padded input chunk are padding bits and should be removed
 - $\ell \bmod 3 = 1$ bytes
    - same, except pad this last 1-byte chunk (8 bits) to 12 bits using 4 zero bits
    - as a result, append two `=` padding characters to the resulting 2-character output chunk.

{: .note}
Padding is actually not necessary since it can be inferred from the output length: i.e., the output length $m \bmod 4$ can be either $0, 2$ or $3$[^omit-padding], in which case we can show that $\ell \bmod 3$ must have been either $0, 1$ or $2$, respectively.
Indeed, some implementations do omit padding (e.g., base64**url**-encoded JWTs and JWSs).

Now, **base64url** is a slight varation on **base64**: as explained in the [JWS RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#appendix-C)[^jwt-rfc].
Specifically, `base64url(m)` is implemented by:

 1. Doing a vanilla `output = base64(input)` Base64 encoding
 2. Stripping the padding (`=`) characters at the end of `output`, if any
 3. Replacing `+` with `-` and replacing `/` with `_` in `output`

Define $\poseidon^\mathbb{S}_\ell(s)$.

### Strings inside ZK circuits

 - String indices start at 0:
    + $s[0]$ is the first character of $s$
    + $s[\len(s) - 1] \bydef s[-1]$ is the last character of $s$.
 - $s[i : j] \bydef \left[ s[0], s[i+1], \ldots, s[j] \right]$ denotes a substring starting at $i$ and ending at $j$ (inclusive).
 - No characters in $s[0:\len(s)-1]$ can be 0 (or null).
 - A string is **zero-padded** up to its **max length**, denoted by $\maxlen(s)$: i.e., $s[\len(s):\maxlen(s) - 1] = [0,\ldots,0]$

### Substring checks from polynomial checks

The **inputs** are:
 - a string $a$ of max length $N$
 - its actual length $\len(a) = n\le N$
 - a _substring_ $b[0\ldots L]$ of max length $L$
 - its actual length $\len(b)=\ell\le L$
 - a starting index $i\in [0,n)$ of $b$ in $a$

Pre-conditions:
 - $a$ is array of bytes
 - $a$ is zero-padded (i.e, $a[n : -1] = \vec{0}$)
 - $b$ is an array of bytes
 - $b$ is zero-paded (i.e, $b[\ell : -1] = \vec{0}$)

The **output** is a bit indicating that the following are all true:
 1. $0 < \ell < n$[^triviality]
 1. $0 \le i + (\ell - 1) < n$ (i.e., we need to "leave room" for $b$ in $a$)
 1. $a[i : i + (\ell - 1)] = b$ (i.e., $b$ is a substring of $a$ starting at index $i$)

Below, we will describe solutions to this problem as initially-interactive **protocols** between a **prover** $\prover$ and a **verifier** $\verifier$.
In the keyless relation, the prover $\prover$ is the user/dapp (or proving service) computing the zkSNARK proof and the verifier $\verifier$ is the relation logic itself.
Then, we convert the protocol to be non-interactive.

#### Monomial-based protocol

{: .todo}
Describe.

#### Lagrange-based protocol

The key idea is that we can represent the strings $a$ and $b$ as univariate polynomials $A(X)$ and $B(X)$, respectively, such that
\begin{align}
A(\omega^j) = a_j,\forall j\in[0,n)\\\\\
B(\omega^j) = b_j,\forall j\in[0,\ell)
\end{align}
where $\omega$ is a primitive $N$th root of unity (assume $N$ is a power of two).
Note that the degrees will be $n-1$ and $\ell-1$, respectively.

The key observation is that $b$ is a substring of $a$ starting at index $i$ if, and only if, $\exists Q(X)$ of degree $(n-1) - \ell$ such that:
\begin{align}
A(X) = Q(X) \underbrace{(X-\omega^i)\ldots(X-\omega^{i+(\ell-1)})}_{\bydef Z(X)} + B(X\omega^{-i})
\end{align}

<!--
    R(i) = B(0)
    R(i+1) = B(1)
    ...
    R(i+\ell - 1) = B(\ell-1)
    =>
    B(X) = R(X + i)
    =>
    B(X - i) = R(X)
-->

**Step 1:** $\prover$ sends $a, n, N, b, \ell, L, i, Q(X)$ to the $\verifier$. 

**Step 2:** $\verifier$ first checks:

 1. Is $0 < \ell < n$?
 2. Is $0 \le i + (\ell - 1) < n$?
 3. $\deg Q(X) \equals (n -  1) - \ell$

**Step 3:** $\verifier$ picks a random challenge $\alpha\in\F$ and checks.
\begin{align}
A(\alpha) = Q(\alpha) Z(\alpha) + B(\alpha \omega^{-i})
\end{align}
where:
\begin{align}
Z(X) &= \prod_{j = i}^{i + (\ell - 1)} (X - \omega^i)\\\\\
A(X) &= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_i \ell_{i,N}(X)\\\\\
B(X) &= \sum_{j=0}^{\ell-1} b_i \ell_{i,N}(X)\\\\
\end{align}
Recall that the Lagrange polynomials for interpolating a vector of max size $N$ are:
\begin{align}
\ell_{i,N}(X) &= \frac{\omega^i (X^N - 1)}{N (X - \omega^i)}
\end{align}

Computing $Q(\alpha)$ is easy because we will have its coefficients.
But, to quickly compute $A(\alpha)$ and $B(\alpha)$, we use Lagrange interpolation: e.g.,:
\begin{align}
A(\alpha) &\bydef \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_i \ell_{i,N}(\alpha)\\\\\
    &= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_i \frac{\omega^i (\alpha^N - 1)}{N (\alpha - \omega^i)}
\end{align}

{: .note}
In a circuit, we can hopefully have the $\omega^i$'s and $1/N$ as constants in the R1CS matrices.
(Cheaply? Without repeating them?)

#### Non-interactive 

To make the protocol above **non-interactive**, the verifier can pick the random challenge $\alpha$ via the Fiat-Shamir (FS) transform:
\begin{align}
\alpha \gets H(a, n, N, i, b, \ell, L, i, Q(X))
\end{align}

{: .warning}
This will involve more hashing work than the naive, non-Lagrange protocol.
It will also involve a degree-check on $Q(X)$ (is it cheaper than the mask in the current protocol?).
It will involve additionally interpolating $Z(\alpha)$ and $Q(\alpha)$.
And I think it may be more expensive to do the interpolation of $A(\alpha), B(\alpha)$.
So the mask-based protocol should be cheaper.

[^cancellation-txns]: This mode can be implemented via account abstraction or via smart contract wallets and would be most effective if your wallet (or some other trusted 3rd party) monitors the chain for key-rotation activities. If so, your wallet would submit the cancellation TXN. (This TXN can be pre-signed too.)
[^esk-across-devices]: Why? AFAICT, this flow will require transmitting an ephemeral secret key (ESK) across different devices in order to quickly get access to the same keyless account on all your devices.
[^esk-not-in-local-storage]: In this case, since the ESK is typically stored in the browser's _local storage_, it will be long gone and the user would have rely on Google's digital signatures to install a new ESK. But this installation would be subject to the timeout period.
[^hardware-wallet]: ...and very few new users can be assumed to have a hardware wallet so as to side-step the 12-word seed phrase problem (assuming the hardware wallet even supports the new chain that the new user is trying to experiment with).
[^jwt-rfc]: The JWT RFC merely defers to the [JW**S** RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-2) as to what "base64url encoding" means
[^not-just-google]: I use "Google" as a canonical example of an OIDC provider. I stress that keyless accounts are **not** restricted with Google and are designed to work with any OIDC provider (e.g., Apple, GitHub, Facebook, etc.)
[^omit-padding]: First, observe that there is no possible last input chunk size that has a 1-character output chunk: the smallest input chunk size is 1 byte, which requires 2 base64 characters (after padding this input chunk to 12 bits). The other cases are when the last output chunk is either 2 or 3 characters. But those correspond to exactly the edge cases when $\ell \bmod 3 = 1$ and $\ell \bmod 3 = 2$.
[^optionality]: Plus, you can anyway later give optionality to your users and allow them to rotate their account to self-custody. Or, to have a backup secret key. Or, to only rely on Google as a recovery method with a timeout, as per the "highly-secure mode" [here](#can-google-steal-my-account). It's just like in the Web 2 world, users can add a 2nd authentication factor to their accounts.
[^triviality]: We are not interested in trivially checking that the empty string is a sub-string, nor that $b$ is a substring of itself. In fact, we may even get into trouble if we accidentally check that in the keyless relation.
