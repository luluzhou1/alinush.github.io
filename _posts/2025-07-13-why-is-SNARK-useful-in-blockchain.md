## What is SNARK?

**SNARK** stands for *Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge*.
It’s a type of cryptographic proof that’s **short and fast to verify**.

In simple terms, a SNARK lets someone prove that a computation was done correctly — **without showing all the work**, and **without needing to interact** with the verifier.
Anyone can check the proof using **far less computation** than redoing the entire task.

Of course, there’s no such thing as a free lunch —
**generating** the proof usually takes **more work** than just running the computation.

Historically, it was hard to find real-world uses for SNARKs.
Take a traditional server-client model:
If only **one client** wants to verify something,
why should the server spend extra effort making a proof?
**Why not just let the client run the computation themselves?**



## Why is it Useful in Blockchain?

In Blockchain, the dynamics change.
Now, it’s not just one client — it’s **hundreds or thousands** of nodes
that want to verify the **same computation**.

If one node (the "server") generates a SNARK proof,
**everyone else can verify it quickly and efficiently**.
Suddenly, the extra work done by one party saves tons of effort for the rest.

This flips the cost-benefit equation:
**One expensive proof can replace thousands of expensive verifications.**

That’s why SNARKs are such a powerful tool in blockchain systems.
