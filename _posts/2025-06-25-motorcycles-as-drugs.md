**tl;dr:** Motorcycles are drugs.

<strike>Alin might buy a motorcycle and risk the few, still-functioning limbs in his body.
Someone should convince him not to do this.</strike>

**Update** _(July 2020)_: Alin purchased a [2017 Honda Rebel 500](/pictures/moto/rebel-500.jpg).
He has never been more happy and frightened at the same time.
Even after taking basic, intermediate and advanced riding clinics, he remains terrified.
This is probably for the best.
Wish him luck.

**Update** _(October 2021 and March 2022)_: Since July 2020, Alin continues to have all his limbs.
Encouraged by these developments, Alin has bought a [2019 BMW R1250GS](/pictures/moto/r1250gs-just-bought.jpg).
Soon after, he traded-in his Rebel 500 for a brand new [2022 Honda Rebel 1100 DCT](/pictures/moto/rebel-1100-jjlake.jpg).
He is clearly disturbed.
Someone please help him.

**Update** _(April 2024)_: Alin is visiting Romania.
He just finished a 2-week, cross-country motorcycling adventure, from California to Texas (and back).
He is experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.
His body is trembling, his spirit is weak and he impulsively buys a [CFMOTO 700 CL-X Sport](/pictures/moto/cfmoto-700clx.jpg).
This bike is a walking contradiction: it has cool features like Brembo brakes, GPS tracking and bar-end mirrors but rides like s\*\*\*, may have clutch issues, and sounds-and-feels like a coffee grinder.

**Update** _(June 2024)_: Alin remains in one piece.
Inspired by this turn of events, Alin has bought a [2024 Ducati Panigale V4S](/pictures/moto/panigale-v4s.jpg).
At the time, the main thought going through his head was: _"A good death is its own reward."_
Please pray for him.
(The Rebel 1100 and R1250GS have since been sold.)

<!--
To deal with his predisposition towards death, Alin has been doing several things:

 1. Taking motorcycle courses:
    * In June 2020, he passed the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's Basic Rider Course
    - In Novemeber 2020, he passed Total Control Training's Intermediate Riding Clinic
 2. Practicing deliberately, carefully increasing his area of competence.
 2. Watching [after-crash reviews by "Dan Dan The Fireman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkRV5Q4sb8c&ab_channel=DanDanTheFireman), to learn from others' mistakes.
    - **WARNING:** Watching such videos before you take a motorcycle safety course can be terrifying and will likely prevent you from ever getting on a motorcycle. 
    - Most of the accidents in the video are caused by the motorcyclist's inability to **take responsibility** for their own safety.
    - That personal responsibility is taught in rider courses (such as the ones above) and by other motorcyclists.
    - At the same time, one must recognize that no amount of personal responsibility will make motorcycles (or cars) completely safe.
