### The official statement

<!-- ![](/pictures/tbow-th.jpg){: .align-right} -->

I was born and raised in [Pitești](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitesti), a small city in Romania, and moved to the US in 2008.
I was always fascinated with computers: playing on them, fixing them & programming them.
I like to read, write and talk about _ideas_.
You can see some of my writing on [this website](/archive.html) and on [Decentralized Thoughts](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/).

I am currently a _Postdoctoral Researcher_ at [VMware Research](https://research.vmware.com).
My broad [research interests](/papers.html) are in cryptography and its practical applications. 
I am very interested in authenticated data structures, especially if based on more exotic primitives, such as [constant-sized polynomial commitments](/2020/05/06/kzg-polynomial-commitments.html). 
In the past, I’ve worked on transparency logs, threshold cryptography, anonymous cryptocurrencies, scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols, append-only logs on top of Bitcoin, and oblivious file systems.

### The truth

Alin is a prolific slav-squatter. 
In his free time, he likes to play piano, sit in coffee shops, and lift things up and put them back down again.
Slowly.
He also enjoys travelling, but only to destinations with total solar eclipses.
Naturally, he dislikes clouds.
(Please join him in Antarctica, in 2021.) 
Alin might buy a motorcycle and risk the few, still-functioning limbs in his body.
Someone should convince him not to do this.
