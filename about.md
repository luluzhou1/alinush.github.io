## The "official" statement...

<!-- ![](/pictures/tbow-th.jpg){: .align-right} -->

I was born and raised in [Pitești](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitesti), a small city in Romania, and moved to the US in 2008.
I was always fascinated with computers: playing on them, fixing them & programming them.
I like to read and write.
In fact, you can see some of my writing on [this website](/archive.html) and on [Decentralized Thoughts](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/about-alin).

I am currently the _Head of Cryptography_ at [Aptos Labs](https://aptoslabs.com).

Before Aptos Labs, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Scientist at VMware Research.

Before VMware, I was a cryptography PhD student at MIT, advised by [Srini Devadas](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/).

Before MIT, I was building tamper-proof clouds and end-to-end encrypted outsourced file storage at [Private Machines](https://privatemachines.com/).

### ...and some of my research

My cryptography research interests are best reflected in my [papers](/papers.html), some of my [posts](/archive.html) and [talks](/talks.html), my ["cryptomat"](/cryptomat) and this [Call for Research](/please-solve).

I've led and thoroughly enjoyed research on:
 1. [keyless blockchain accounts](/2024/06/13/Keyless-blockchain-accounts-on-Aptos.html)
 1. [anonymous cryptocurrencies](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/452)
 1. **Herkle trees**, or _homomorphic_ Merkle trees: [AMTs](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2020/349700b367/1j2LgjE3Q6Q) and [Hyperproofs](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22fall_srinivasan.pdf)
 1. [constant-sized vector commitments](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57990-6_3)
 1. [fast threshold BLS signatures](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2020/349700b367/1j2LgjE3Q6Q)
 1. [Verkle trees](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2019/conf/12-5-Kuszmaul.pdf)
 1. [transparency logs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345652)
 1. [append-only logs on top of Bitcoin](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345652)

I've also helped with, although not led, research on 
 - [aggregatable distributed key generation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77870-5_6)
 - [share recovery for verifiable secret sharing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3354207)
 - [scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809541)
 - [oblivious file systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2382196.2382299)


## The _truth_

Alin is a prolific slav-squatter.

In his free time, he likes to play piano, ride [motorcycles](/moto), and lift things up and put them back down again.

_Slowly..._

He also enjoys travelling, but only to destinations with total solar eclipses.

Naturally, he dislikes clouds.

<p>Please join him in
<strike>Antarctica, in 2021;
or, in Winnemucca, Nevada on October 14th, 2023;
or, in <a href="/motorcycling-from-ca-to-tx">Austin, Texas, on April 8th, 2024</a></strike>
Spain, on August 12th, 2026.</p>

Alin's has two superpowers: finding the worst spot to see solar eclipses and summoning clouds that cover the entire sky.
